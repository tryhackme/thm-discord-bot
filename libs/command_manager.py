"""Command Manager module to handle permissions checking and other utilities.

This module manages the permissions checking system in a standardized and consistent method.
Main usage is a decorator method that is called after the bot listener's method, but before the
command itself to properly perform permission checks prior to command execution.
Module also includes a bot error message method and input sanitation check.
i.e.

Typical usage example:
    import libs.command_manager as command_manager
    from discord.ext import commands

    @commands.command(...)        # Required bot listener method
    @command_manager.check(roles=["admin",
                                  "mod",  ],
                           channels=["staff_channel",],)
    async fun_command(self, ctx, user_input=""): # Your command to be executed after the check
        if command_manager.is_sanitized(user_input):
            do_thing()
        else:
            command_manager.error_response(ctx, "not_sanitized")
        ...

    """Decorator to check role permissions and context for the user invoking a bot command.

    Wrap around a bot command to check appropriate permission and channel context of the executed command from
    the Context object provided by the bot's event listener method, and errors out if checks do not pass.
    String names of roles and channels are derived from config/config.json keys.
    All exceptions raised are inherited from Discord.ext.commands

    Args:
        roles: String array of whitelisted roles from config.json that the user must have .
        channels: String array of whitelisted channels from config.json that the command can be executed in.
        dm_flag: Boolean flag to set a DM-Only command if True, or public channels only command if False.

    Returns:
        Original method call that the method wraps around, and continues executing the command/method.
        If any checks fail, then will stop execution of the method and returns False after raising an exception.

    Raises:
        PrivateMessageOnly: Command is invoked in a public channel while arg dm_flag is True.
        NoPrivateMessage: Command is invoked in a DM while arg dm_flag is False.
        CommandInvokeError: Command is not invoked in the whitelist of arg channels.
        MissingAnyRole: Context.author does not have a role in the whitelist of arg roles.
